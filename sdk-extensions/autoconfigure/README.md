# OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure

This artifact implements environment-based autoconfiguration of the OpenTelemetry SDK. This can be
an alternative to programmatic configuration using the normal SDK builders.


The full documentation on the available configuration options has been moved to
[opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/configuration/)
