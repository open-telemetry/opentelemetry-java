/**
 * Specifies the method of aggregating metric values.
 *
 * <p>TODO: This is intentionally not the same as metrics/AggregationTemporality. For profiles.proto
 * 'v1experimental' version, this class is considered distinct from the pre-exiting
 * AggregationTemporality in metrics.proto. As the profiles.proto stabilises, they may be refactored
 * into a version in common.proto. Meanwhile the Java class structure reflects the .proto structure
 * in making distinct entities.
 *
 * <p>refs for refactoring discussion:
 *
 * @see
 *     "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/v1.3.0/opentelemetry/proto/metrics/v1/metrics.proto#L261"
