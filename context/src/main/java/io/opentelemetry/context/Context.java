/**
 * A context propagation mechanism which can carry scoped-values across API boundaries and between
 * threads.
 *
 * <p>A Context object can be {@linkplain #makeCurrent set} to the {@link ContextStorage}, which
 * effectively forms a <b>scope</b> for the context. The scope is bound to the current thread.
 * Within a scope, its Context is accessible even across API boundaries, through {@link #current}.
 * The scope is later exited by {@link Scope#close()} closing} the scope.
 *
 * <p>Context objects are immutable and inherit state from their parent. To add or overwrite the
 * current state a new context object must be created and then attached, replacing the previously
 * bound context. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Context withCredential = Context.current().with(CRED_KEY, cred);
 * withCredential.wrap(new Runnable() {
 *   public void run() {
 *      readUserRecords(userId, CRED_KEY.get());
 *   }
 * }).run();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Notes and cautions on use:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Every {@link #makeCurrent()} must be followed by a {@link Scope#close()}. Breaking these
 *       rules may lead to memory leaks and incorrect scoping.
 *   <li>While Context objects are immutable they do not place such a restriction on the state they
 *       store.
 *   <li>Context is not intended for passing optional parameters to an API and developers should
 *       take care to avoid excessive dependence on context when designing an API.
 *   <li>Attaching Context from a different ancestor will cause information in the current Context
 *       to be lost. This should generally be avoided.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Context propagation is not trivial, and when done incorrectly can lead to broken traces or
 * even mixed traces. We provide a debug mechanism for context propagation, which can be enabled by
 * setting {@code -Dio.opentelemetry.context.enableStrictContext=true} in your JVM args. This will
 * enable a strict checker that makes sure that {@link Scope}s are closed on the correct thread and
 * that they are not garbage collected before being closed. This is done with some relatively
 * expensive stack trace walking. It is highly recommended to enable this in unit tests and staging
 * environments, and you may consider enabling it in production if you have the CPU budget or have
 * very strict requirements on context being propagated correctly (i.e., because you use context in
 * a multi-tenant system). For kotlin coroutine users, this will also detect invalid usage of {@link
 * #makeCurrent()} from coroutines and suspending functions. This detection relies on internal APIs
 * of kotlin coroutines and may not function across all versions - let us know if you find a version
 * of kotlin coroutines where this mechanism does not function.
