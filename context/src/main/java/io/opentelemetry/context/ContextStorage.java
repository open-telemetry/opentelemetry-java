 * >   @Override
 * >   public ContextStorage get() {
 * >     ContextStorage threadLocalStorage = ContextStorage.defaultStorage();
 * >     return new RequestContextStorage() {
 * >       @Override
 * >       public Scope T attach(Context toAttach) {
 * >         Context current = current();
 * >         setMdc(toAttach);
 * >         Scope scope = threadLocalStorage.attach(toAttach);
 * >         return () -> {
 * >           clearMdc();
 * >           setMdc(current);
 * >           scope.close();
 * >         }
 * >       }
 * >
 * >       @Override
