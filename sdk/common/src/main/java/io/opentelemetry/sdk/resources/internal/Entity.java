/**
 * Entity represents an object of interest associated with produced telemetry: traces, metrics or
 * logs.
 *
 * <p>For example, telemetry produced using OpenTelemetry SDK is normally associated with a Service
 * entity. Similarly, OpenTelemetry defines system metrics for a host. The Host is the entity we
 * want to associate metrics with in this case.
 *
 * <p>Entities may be also associated with produced telemetry indirectly. For example a service that
 * produces telemetry is also related with a process in which the service runs, so we say that the
 * Service entity is related to the Process entity. The process normally also runs on a host, so we
 * say that the Process entity is related to the Host entity.
 *
 * <p>This class is internal and is hence not for public use. Its APIs are unstable and can change
