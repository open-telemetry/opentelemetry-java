# OpenTelemetry QuickStart

Our quickstart guide has been migrated to the [OpenTelemetry documentation website](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/java/manual_instrumentation/).

The source for the documentation website can be found in our [website_docs](website_docs) folder in
this repository. If you have updates to the documentation, please open a pull request that updates the documents
in that location. Thanks!
